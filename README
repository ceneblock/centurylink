This simple script will grab followers off of github.

It'll output in json as the following:

{
    "octocat": {
        "myhduck": {
            "SuriyaaKudoIsc": [
                "jovenmarlo",
                "hunslater",
                "jmg",
                "pnommensen",
                "matiasinsaurralde"
            ],
            "mitra97": [
                "vparthas",
                "teejas"
            ]
        },

In this case, we're looking at "octocat" who has a follower called "myhduck".
"myhduck" has a follower called "SuriyaaKudoIsc" who has the a maximum of five
followers: "jovenmarlo", "hunslater", "jmg", "pnommensen", "matiasinsaurralde"

As we can see with "mitra97", they only have two followers, so those are shown.


To run this, simply place it on a php enabled webserver that has php-curl and
php-json installed and point your web browser to it.

If that user exists, then you'll be presented with a download option which
contains more full version of the json file.
